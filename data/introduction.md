My name's Nurul, I'm a fan of Go and love coding with it, I used PHP and C# too in the past but for now I'm focusing on Go and JavaScript.
I have been working with programming professionally for 5+ years.

Currently I'm working as a freelance web developer, you can check some of my works [here](/#/showcase), or get my [CV](https://cand-data.kalibrr.com/www.kalibrr.com/profile/2ZFHCY3XVUJAPQF9CZW4VLKYG2R4NNFJGTETKRX3-62050eb3.pdf).
