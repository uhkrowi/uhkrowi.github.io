I'm a fan of Go and love coding with it, I used PHP and C# too in the past but for now I'm focusing on Go and JavaScript.
I have been working with programming professionally for 5+ years.
There're some stacks I'm using to work with:

- GoFiber
- Express.js
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Wordpress
- Heroku
- Netlify
- Twilio
